## Description

This project focuses on the foundational concepts of the shell in Unix-like operating systems. It covers the creation of aliases, the purpose of shell initialization files, and the use and expansion of shell variables. Each script is a self-contained task designed to practice these core skills.

## Learning Objectives

* Understanding and creating aliases.
* Familiarity with shell initialization files like `/etc/profile` and `~/.bashrc`.
* Declaring, using, and expanding shell variables.
* Mastering basic shell expansions for commands and arithmetic.
